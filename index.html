            <h3>About Kilbrittain</h3>
            <p>Kilbrittain is situated midway between Kinsale & Clonakilty. This scenic part of West Cork has many sandy beaches and castles to offer the visitor, a mecca for walkers, cyclists, water sport enthusiasts, bird watchers, fishermen and horse riders.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="marker-2">
            <h3>Fin Whale</h3>
            <p>On 15 Jan 2009 an 18 metre fin whale stranded and subsequently died on Burren Beach. The people of Kilbrittain organised to save its skeleton which is now displayed in the village. The whale was featured in a Channel 4 documentary “Inside Nature’s Giants” which showed autopsies of large mammals. It is still viewable on the Channel 4 website or on YouTube.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="marker-3">
            <h3>Playground</h3>
            <p>There is a lovely picnic area and a great children’s playground with separate areas for Under 6, 6-14 and adult exercise equipment. There is also a sensory garden right beside the playground.</p>

It was then purchased and restored by inventor Russell Winn in 1969. Winn invented a remote control robot vehicle for bomb disposal.
